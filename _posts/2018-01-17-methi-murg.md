    1. Marinate chicken with cumin powder, 1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp ground coriander, lemon juice and salt and set aside for 30 minutes.
    2. Switch on Instant Pot in Sauté mode and heat 3 tbsp oil. Add chopped onion and ginger and garlic paste and let it sauté until onions turn golden brown, about 4 minutes.
    3. Add 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder, 1 tsp ground coriander, a little salt and let it cook, around 3-4 minutes till the spices are cooked properly. Add 1 cup water, little at a time, and keep stirring to prevent spices from sticking to the surface of the pot.
    4. Add marinated chicken and mix properly. Chicken should be coated evenly. Add 1/2 cup water (optional) and season with salt.
    5. Turn Instant Pot off and close the lid. Turn it back on and cook chicken on high pressure for 4 minutes, in Sealing mode.
    6. When time is up, do a quick release and open the lid carefully. Now add chopped methi (fenugreek leaves) and yogurt whisked with 3 tbsp water. Mix well.
    7. Close the lid and cook chicken on high pressure for 3 more minutes, in Sealing mode.
    8. Open the lid when the time is up. If desired consistency is not achieved, let the curry cook on sauté mode for excess water to evaporate.
    9. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice or chapatis.

Methi is fresh fenugreek leaves and Murg means chicken. What makes it different from other chicken curries is the unique taste and aroma of fenugreek leaves which also brings A LOT of benefits with it. Go online to read all about it.

This ultimate combination is perfect for dinner or lunch option and can be cooked in less than 30 minutes. I would recommend using chicken thighs because they are more tender and juicier once cooked in a curry. This recipe can be cooked on gas stove too, just add little more water while cooking the chicken.

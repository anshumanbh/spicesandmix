Hakka noodles is one of the most liked Indo-Chinese food in India. Available with street vendors all around, hakka noodles tastes best with [chilli chicken](https://www.spicesandmix.com/non-vegetarian/2018/01/31/chilli-chicken/) or manchurian. 

Very easy to cook, this one pot dish is always a favourite at a dinner party or with kids. Also a good way to use the vegetable at the end of the week before they go bad. Take it up a notch higher and add some eggs or sautéed chicken, beef, pork or shrimp to make it more flavourful.

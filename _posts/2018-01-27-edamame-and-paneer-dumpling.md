    * Garam masala, 1/8 Tsp 
    * Paneer, crumbled, 3/4 cup ( submerge it in warm water for 15-20 minutes if you are using packaged paneer to make it soft)
    * Milk, 3 1/2 tbsp (I used 2%)
    * Ginger paste, 1/8 Tsp
    * Garlic paste, 1/8 Tsp

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Boil edamame in seasoned water for 10 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and rinse with cold water so that edamame don’t stick to each other.
    2. In a food processor, process edamame with olive oil and little water, to a smooth mixture.
    3. Add shallots, chilli powder, garam masala, paneer, milk, ginger paste, garlic paste, lemon juice and salt to edamame mixture and process to make a smooth paste.
    4. Keep wonton wrappers covered with a damp cloth and take a couple out at a time while folding. 
    5. Place two teaspoon of filling in the centre of a wonton wrapper and damp the edges with water using fingers.
    6. Bring opposite corners together to form a triangle and press along the edges. Make sure the edges adhere to each other and there is no air pocket inside.
    7. Moisten the two ends of wide side and bring them together. Press to adhere. Repeat the process for all wrappers. Keep dumplings covered with a damp cloth to prevent from getting dry.
    8. Line bamboo steamers with parchment paper and brush with oil if the wrappers get dry. Place dumplings in the steamer and make sure they are not touching each other.
    9. Fill a wide pan or wok with 2-inch water and bring to a boil. Place the steamer over or in the wok/pan.
    10. Cover and cook dumplings for around 6-8 minutes, until cooked properly and tender.
    11. Serve hot with chilli oil or any dipping sauce.

Ever since trying Edamame Dumpling in one of the restaurants, I always wanted to recreate the dish but wanted to add my own touch to it. Hence, to Indian-ize it, I added paneer in the filling which also gives a smooth velvety texture to the filling.

This version screams fusion and trust me when I say that you can’t have just some, so having a batch in the freezer would be a good idea. Served the dumplings with chilli oil, the recipe of which is by [omnivorescookbook](https://omnivorescookbook.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/). 

Below is a step-by-step instruction on how to fold dumplings. I hope you enjoy this recipe while I go and think of some other variation.

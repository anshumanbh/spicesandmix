    1. In a frying pan roast all the seeds on low flame till they start giving off an aroma. Should take 3-4 minutes. Cool it down and grind them to a fine powder. This is the Achaari Masala. Store it in an airtight container.
    2. In a pan heat 2 tbsp oil. Add chopped cauliflower and heat on a high flame. After 2 minutes add 1/2 tsp salt and 2-3 tbsp water. As soon as water heats up cover the pan and let cauliflower cook in steam for 3-4 minutes on medium low flame. Cook till cauliflower is soft but not mushy. 
    3. Once cooked remove cauliflower from the pan and keep it aside.
    4. Add 1 tbsp oil to the pan (or less if there is leftover oil in the pan). Add potatoes and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook on high flame till potatoes get light golden color on all sides. 
    5. At this point add 1/2 cup water to the pan and let it heat. Cover the pan and let potatoes cook on medium slow flame till they are almost cooked, for 5-6 minutes. When they are soft enough remove potatoes from the pan and keep it aside.
    6. In the same pan heat 2 tbsp oil. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, nigella seeds, fenugreek seeds and fennel seeds. Let them splutter.
    7. Add chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and a pinch of salt. Let onions saut√© on medium flame till light golden brown.
    8. Now add tomatoes, cook on high flame for a minute. Lower the flame and add little salt, turmeric, chilli powder, coriander powder and 2-3 tsp achaari masala. Mix well and let it cook on medium slow flame till the spices are cooked and tomatoes are soft.
    9. At this point add previously cooked cauliflower and potatoes and mix well. Cover the pan and cook on a medium flame for 3-4 minutes.
    10. Now add yogurt and mix well. Taste to check the seasoning and add salt accordingly.
  
    NOTE:
    1. I make extra achaari masala and store it in an airtight container. It can be used on any other veggie/curries or on roasted veggies, meat or in marinations.
    2. Cooking time may vary depending on the quality of the vegetables. Keep on checking the consistency and taste while cooking.
    3. For more achaari flavor prepare a  tempering/chaunk of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, nigella seeds and little chilli powder in vegetable oil. Add it to the dish in the end once Achaari Aloo Gobhi is cooked.

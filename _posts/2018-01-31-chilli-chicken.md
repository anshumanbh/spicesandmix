    1. Make a thick batter of flour, cornstarch, ginger paste, garlic paste, soy sauce, vinegar, salt and water (as needed). Coat chicken pieces with the batter evenly on all sides.
    2. Put 2-inch oil in a pan and heat it. Shallow fry chicken in batches on medium-high flame. Chicken should be cooked to golden brown color, at least 3-4 minutes on each side. Take chicken out on a wide plate, lined with paper towel to soak excess oil.
    3. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok or pan. Add ginger, garlic and green chillies and fry until light brown. Till it stops giving off aroma.
    4. Add onion and bell pepper and sauté for 2 minutes on medium-high flame. Add rice vinegar, chilli garlic paste, soy sauce and green chilli sauce. Mix well.
    5. Mix cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and make a slurry. Add the slurry and chicken stock into the pan. Bring to a boil and season with salt. 
    6. Add chicken pieces and spring onions and cook for 2 minutes on medium-high flame until chicken is properly coated with sauce. 
    7. Garnish with spring onions and serve hot with noodles or fried rice.

Indo-Chinese is a modified Chinese cuisine which is famous in India and Pakistan and is spicier compared to authentic Chinese cuisine. 

If there is one dish I like the most in the world, it is Chilli Chicken. It is my potion that can cure me of any disease, cough, cold or fever and my Dad knew that very well. Every time I would fall ill, Chinese food takeout used to be our dinner. 

Growing up in India, I always believed that the Chinese food we ate and loved so much is, in fact, authentic Chinese cuisine. Much to my disappointment, when I went to an authentic Chinese restaurant after moving to the US for the first time, I was utterly shocked. The real authentic Chinese food tasted no way near to what I was used to eating in the form of Indo Chinese cuisines such as Chilli Chicken or Manchurian. Now, after being in the states for quite some time now, I have these occasional cravings for Chilli Chicken and it is extremely difficult to find a place that serves authentic Chilli Chicken, the taste I know of. 

I prefer to use chicken thighs for the fact that they are more tender even after frying and cooking with the sauces. 

 Note:
1. Using chicken stock instead of water in gravy gives a very nice flavor. 
2. The ratio of different sauces can be modified according to taste.
3. If you want dry chilli chicken, skip adding chicken stock and cook chicken with the sauce for 4-5 minutes.
4. This is a spicy recipe but spice level can be altered according to personal taste.

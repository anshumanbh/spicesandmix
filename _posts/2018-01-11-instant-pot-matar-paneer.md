One of the most amazing things about vegetarian curry dishes is that it can be cooked with any vegetable of choice and in various ways. I saw some Paneer in the fridge and there were just enough frozen peas to make Matar Paneer. Matar is Peas in Hindi and Paneer is the famous Indian cottage cheese.

This is the best Instant Pot dish I have cooked and tried yet. Hands down!! Incredibly easy to cook and ready in about 30 minutes, this dish is perfect for quick weekday dinner and a delicious curry to serve to guests if you are hosting a dinner party.

Don’t have an Instant Pot? Don’t worry. Follow the same recipe and cook it on a gas stove.

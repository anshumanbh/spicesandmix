    1. Soak chickpeas in 6 cups of water for 4-6 hours or overnight. Strain the water, wash chickpeas with cold water and keep it aside in a bowl.
    2. To make a spice bag, also known as bouquet garni: Cut cheesecloth into a 10-inch square. Place peppercorns, black cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves and tea leaves in the middle. Bring all corners together and tie them with kitchen twine or a string, making sure there are no gaps. Refer to the note.
    3. Switch on your Instant Pot on Sauté mode. Heat oil and then add bay leaf and cumin seeds. Let it heat for 30 seconds.
    4. Now add ginger and garlic and sauté till it turns light brown, around a minute.
    5. Add onions and sauté for 2 minutes until it gets golden brown in color. Add some salt to speed up the sautéing process.
    6. At this point add canned tomatoes, coriander powder, turmeric, red chilli powder and mix well. This is the chhole masala and needs to be cooked well until all tomato pieces have been incorporated into the mixture and the spices are cooked, about 8-10 minutes. Keep it covered to prevent unwanted splattering and stir occasionally. See the note.
    7. Add chickpeas and mix properly to coat the mixture evenly. Let chickpeas cook in the mixture for 2-3 minutes.
    8. Turn Instant Pot off. Add water, spice bag and salt. Cover with the lid and cook chickpeas on high pressure for 35 minutes, with the valve in Sealing position.
    9. When the time is up, let the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Then, manually release the remaining pressure and open the lid carefully. With the help of a tong take spice bag out and discard it.
    10. Add garam masala and dried mango powder/amchur and mix well. Cook the curry on sauté mode. To thicken the curry, mash some chickpeas using a masher or with the back of a spatula. You can also add boiled potatoes to thicken the curry. If the curry is too dry, add more water.
    11. Let the curry cook for 8-10 minutes or until desired consistency has been achieved. Check seasoning.
    12. Garnish with cilantro and serve hot.

Chhole or Chickpeas Masala/Curry is a very common Indian dish and usually finds its place on a plate during all the major festivals in India. It can be cooked in various ways and is served with rice or roti or poori/bhature (deep-fried Indian flatbreads). 

All the years since I have been eating chhole, the chickpeas were always boiled first and then cooked with spices. But being an Instant Pot convert, I wanted to test its limit by boiling and cooking chickpeas at the same time, while not losing its taste. And it worked!!!! This is the first Instant Pot recipe that I am SO excited to share. Not that I am not happy with my other recipes, but this one is special.

Now, I am a sucker for good masala and can sauté for hours. No kidding! I truly believe that a nicely cooked masala is the foundation of a good curry. Therefore, it is very important to sauté the masala mixture nicely in this recipe, especially when the chickpeas are going to boil at the same time and the curry will get all its flavor from the masala.

Leave a comment and let me know if you try the recipe and like it. Your feedback is my fuel for motivation.

Note:
1. I used a spice bag so that whole spices can be easily discarded after cooking. You can also put the spices as is, and discard them later.
2. Tea leaves give a nice, rich, dark color to the curry. It can also be replaced with a tea bag. However, tea leaves do not affect the taste (unless you put too much and curry becomes bitter) and can be avoided too.
3. The masala mixture is the key component here. So make sure you cook it really well before adding chickpeas.
4. Amchur or dried mango powder gives a tangy taste to the curry. Alternatively, you can also use dried pomegranate seeds powder.

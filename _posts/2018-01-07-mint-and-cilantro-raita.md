Raita (yogurt mixture) is one of the most favourite accompaniments to most dishes in India. It provides a perfect cooling effect with spicy dishes, and can also be eaten as a dish on its own.

Raita can be made with fruits or vegetables or Boondi, which is small fried balls of gram flour. Here I have added a combination of mint and cilantro, that has a freshness to it. Mint and cilantro raita can be paired perfectly with most meat dishes and kebabs.

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. In a large mixing bowl, add dry ingredients with chickpea flour and mix well. Now add water to the mixture slowly while mixing it constantly. The batter should not be too thick nor too thin - just enough to coat onion and potatoes well and not drip too much.
    2. In a wide frying pan, heat oil enough for deep frying. Add potatoes to the batter and coat each slice properly.
    3. When the oil is hot, reduce the flame and put each coated slice carefully in the oil. Fry potatoes while turning them occasionally in medium-low flame, so that it gets cooked nicely.
    4. When the potato coating gets light brown, carefully remove from the oil. Repeat the same process for onion.
    5. Serve hot with green chutney or tomato ketchup.

Fritters or Pakora or Bhajiya are popular Indian street food. I used onions and potatoes for this recipe, but these fritters can be made using a wide variety of vegetables.Â 

Fritters/Pakoras are very popular in almost every kitchen in India, especially during rainy season. Therefore, it was obvious to make them as soon as it rained here in San Diego, especially when it was a weekend. They taste best with cilantro-mint chutney or ketchup; add a cup of chai with the lot and there can be no better evening snack..

Note:
1. Do not cook potatoes in high flame as the coating will cook before potatoes and can get burnt.
2. Cooking in the medium-low flame will also make fritters crispy.
3. The same batter can be used for other vegetables too.

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Marinate Shrimp and keep it aside for 30 minutes.
    2. Heat oil in a pan on a medium flame. Add cumin seeds, onion seeds, mustard seeds, green chilli and curry leaves. Let it heat for a minute until seeds stop spluttering.
    3. Add onion and garlic and let it sauté on medium-low flame until onion becomes golden brown, around 5 minutes.
    4. Now add tomatoes, coriander powder, turmeric and kashmiri chilli powder. Mix it well and let it cook on a medium-low flame for 7-8 minutes. 
    5. At this point, add shrimp and mix it well. Shrimps should get coated with the spices properly.
    6. Add about 2 cups of water, or according to the consistency you like, and garam masala and bring it to a boil. Season with salt.
    7. Once the water comes to boil, add shredded coconut. Cook the curry on medium-low flame for 6-7 minutes if you are using raw shrimp, or 3-4 minutes if you are using cooked shrimp. Over cooking the shrimp will make it hard and rubbery. 
    8. When shrimp is cooked, turn off the heat and serve coconut shrimp curry with rice or chapatis.

I was introduced to shrimps after coming to the United States. It was a love-hate relationship initially but then I tried Shrimp curry. The recipe is on my blog today so I needn’t say more.

I have been trying different recipes and variations of Shrimp curry over the years. After much trying and failing, I can confidently say that this is the one that I like the most. Hope you will enjoy it too!

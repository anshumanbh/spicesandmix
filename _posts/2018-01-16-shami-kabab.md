    1. Mix ground lamb, split chickpeas, dry red chillies, 1/4 cup onion, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric, salt, and 2 cups water. Cook in Instant Pot on high pressure for 3 minutes in Sealing mode. Alternatively, you can also cook on the gas stove in a pan until all the water is evaporated and lentil is cooked properly but not mushy.
    2. After 3 minutes, do a quick release and open the lid. The water should be completely evaporated and lentil should be cooked to tender. If not, turn on the Instant Pot to Sautè mode and cook with regular stirring. It is important for the mixture to be completely dry. Let the mixture cool down completely on a tray or a plate.
    3. In the meantime cook lamb chop, 1 tsp ginger garlic paste, salt and around 2-3 cups water in Instant Pot in high pressure for 7-8 minutes in Sealing mode, until the meat is tender.
    4. While the lamb chop is cooking, in a food processor mix cup cilantro, mint, serrano pepper, 1 cup onion and make a coarse paste. Do not a make a fine paste else onions will become a watery mess.
    5. When Instant Pot time is up, do a quick release and open the lid. Take lamb chop out in a bowl and pound it with light hands using a pestle or a heavy spatula. It should look fibrous and not a paste. This will add texture to kababs. 
    6. Once cooled down, blend the minced lamb mixture in a food processor to a fine paste.
    7. In a large mixing bowl, add blended mixture with shredded lamb, eggs, yogurt, garam masala, mint cilantro paste, salt and mix properly. Eggs will act as a binding agent and yogurt will give a nice colour while frying. 
    8. Make a small patty, shallow fry it in a pan and taste to check seasonings. Adjust accordingly.
    9. Now make medium size patties from the mixture. Make sure the patties are not too thick or too thin. 
    10. In a pan heat oil, enough for shallow frying the kababs. Fry kababs on medium-low flame until golden brown, 2-3 minutes on each side.
    11. Serve hot with mint chutney.

Shami Kabab is minced meat patty, where ground meat - either lamb, beef or goat - is mixed with spices and then shallow fried in a pan. It is very popular in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and is generally eaten as an appetizer. 

Shami Kabab is one of my favourite things that I miss the most about India. Even after trying it in restaurants across the US, I still could not find the taste that I so deeply miss. Hence, it was the perfect dish for me to recreate and share with you guys. Since we are dealing with minced meat which is then fried, it is very easy for the recipe to go the other way and for you to end with a broken patty in oil. This is why please keep following points in mind before making the kababs.

1. Make sure cooked minced mixture has ABSOLUTELY NO WATER and is completely dry before cooling it down.
2. Lentil (Chana daal) should be cooked to a texture that each lentil grain can be seen separately. 
3. DO NOT blend the mixture before it is cooled down.
4. Even after taking all the precautions if you end up with a soft, soggy mixture, do not fret. Adding all-purpose flour will save your day - just add in little quantity at a time.

Now that we are finally making such delicious kababs, why not make some extra and save it for a bad day. You can make extra patties by simply multiplying the recipe and store it in the freezer - just thaw them before frying. Perfect for last-minute dinner or to serve to guests.

    1. Switch on Instant Pot on Sauté mode. Add 3 tbsp mustard oil and let it heat. Add cumin and onion seeds and let it splutter for 30 seconds.
    2. Add onion and sauté them until golden brown, 2-3 minutes.
    3. Add turmeric, coriander powder, Kashmiri chilli powder, salt and mix well. Add 1/2 cup water to prevent from sticking to the surface. Keep stirring and let the spices cook for a minute.
    4. Now, add chicken and mix well. Turn off Instant Pot and close the lid. Switch it on again and cook chicken on high pressure for 5 minutes.
    5. In the meantime, blend cilantro (coriander), mint, green chilli, ginger and garlic in a food processor to a fine paste. Use cilantro and mint with stalks for optimum flavor.
    6. When the Instant Pot beeps, do a quick release and open the lid. Add green paste to the chicken and mix well.
    7. Close the lid and cook chicken again on high pressure for 3 minutes. Do a natural release, for 10 minutes, when the time is up.
    8. After 10 minutes, let the chicken cool down a little. Then add cream and mix well. (this step is optional)
    9. Serve hot with rice or roti.

I think I am just obsessed with greens this season. There is no limit to the number of ways they can be used while cooking. And also a smart way to feed people who don’t like to eat raw greens (read, my husband).

I ate Hariyali Chicken number of times in India, but never thought too much about it, until recently. For those who are wondering, Hariyali means Greenery in Hindi. So, just took some bunches of cilantro and mint, blended them and used the paste in the chicken curry. Used minimal spices, not even garam masala..! Yup, I swear. Or, maybe I forgot and didn't even feel the need to add it later.

I used mustard oil for it amazing flavor. You should try it if you haven’t ever and trust me, there’ll be no looking back. But what about the strong aroma of mustard oil, you ask.? I used Instant Pot to cook this curry, and high heat and pressure took away the strong aroma. If you use the stove top, just let the oil cook for a tad bit more time. That’s it. 

Another magic ingredient I used was onion seeds. I have not tried many dishes with onion seeds in it and I think it is not meant for every dish, because of it’s distinct flavor. I took a chance with this recipe and it worked out perfectly. Also, don’t feel shy to freeze the leftovers. You will thank me later.

One last thing before I forget - I absolutely love Instant Pot!!

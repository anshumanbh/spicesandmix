    1. Wash lamb chops in cold water properly and then pat dry using a paper towel. In a wide pan, heat oil on low flame and add turmeric and salt. Add lamb chops in the pan and sauté on medium flame, till it gets light brown on all sides.
    2. While the meat is sautéing, turn on Instant Pot on Sauté mode. Heat about 2 tbsp oil and add cumin seeds, bay leaf and black cardamom. Let it heat for 30 seconds then add ginger, garlic and green chilli. Mix well and sauté for 2 minutes. 
    3. Now, add onions and sauté until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add chilli powder, coriander powder and mix well with onions. 
    4. Add lamb chops, salt and water, depending on the consistency of the curry you like.
    5. Turn off Instant Pot and close the lid. Turn it back on and cook on high pressure for 15 minutes, with the valve in Sealing position.
    6. After the time is up, do a quick release very carefully. If the valve starts spraying liquid, nudge the valve little at a time using a spatula till most of the pressure is released.
    7. When all the pressure is released, open the lid away from the face carefully. Add whisked yogurt, cilantro and mix well. Now add potatoes and close the lid again. Cook on high pressure for 7 minutes.
    8. Do a quick release after 15 minutes natural release and open the lid carefully. 
    9. Garnish with cilantro and serve hot with rice or chapati.

Goat curry, or as known in India - Mutton curry, or as I fondly remember in Bengali - “Kosha Mangsho” (pronounced as ko-shaa maang-sho), has always been my favourite curry, especially if cooked by Mom. I remember, she used to take hours to sauté masala first and then the meat and in the end pressure cook them together. I tried it multiple times in the US with lamb meat but never got the same taste and meat texture as Mom’s, even when I cooked meat on low flame for hours. Never as good as I remembered it to be...

Thanks to Instant Pot, the problem with the meat texture is solved along with enormous time-saving. First time I cooked lamb curry in Instant Pot, I miscalculated the time and meat became too tender. But it was delicious enough to fall in love! And my half-Bengali self was too ecstatic. There is something about the combination of tender meat, perfect spices and potatoes to not love…Right?! All Bengalis reading this should know what I mean by potato and happiness! Since my Mom is Bengali, growing up I used to see potatoes in almost all curries - egg curry, chicken curry, mutton curry, vegetable curry. Even though I am not a big fan of this particular starch, seeing half potato floating in the curry always made me happy.

With this recipe, I tried to recreate the taste from my Mom’s Indian kitchen to my kitchen in States. And Instant Pot made sure I get the perfect meat tenderness and in less half the time required on a stove top. Most importantly, do not forget that this curry tastes way more delicious the next day!!

Note:
1. I added lamb chops with bone for additional flavour. The cooked meat is fall-off-the-bone tender, so the bones can be discarded later.
2. DO NOT cut meat and potatoes into small pieces. High-pressure cooking will make it into a mush. 
3. I only added Kashmiri chilli powder for colour. If using green chillies, you may not need additional heat so be mindful.
4. Instead of adding water, any meat stock will add more flavour.
5. Do not add yogurt directly else it will crumble in the curry.

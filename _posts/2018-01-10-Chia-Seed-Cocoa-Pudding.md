I never ate chia pudding before this!!! Just didn’t get a chance. And I am so glad I tried this recipe for the first time and can surely say its going to be one of my favourite breakfasts from now on.

I used the recipe by Minimalist Baker as my base recipe and then made changes as I saw fit. One of the interesting substitute was jaggery in place of agave, maple syrup, honey or any other sweetener. 

Jaggery can be made from palm tree sap or sugarcane juice and is a big thing in southeast Asia. I have always had the one made by sugarcane juice, where fresh sugarcane juice is boiled until it is reduced and solidified. It’s mostly consumed in winters and has numerous health benefits. Jaggery is, however, not as sweet as maple syrup. So you might need a little bit more in your recipes than other usual sweeteners. But with all the amazing benefits associated with it, I would say why not.

This chia pudding can be made a night before and can last for a couple of days if stored in the fridge. I prefer it unblended but if you like a smooth texture, blending is the way for you. I love how easy it is to make and is packed with good dose of energy. Perfect fuel for the day!

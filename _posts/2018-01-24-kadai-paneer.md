    1. Roast first five ingredients on low flame till they turn light brown and starts giving off aroma. Turn the heat off.
    2. When the spices cool down, grind them in a grinder to a semi-coarse powder. This is the Kadai Masala. Keep it aside.
    3. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan (better to use a wok) on a medium-low flame and add onions. Sauté till it becomes light golden brown, around 5 minutes. Adding a pinch of salt speeds up the sautéing process.
    4. Add tomatoes and let it sauté for 7-8 minutes until mixture starts releasing oil. Turn off the heat.
    5. Blend the mixture in a blender to a coarse purée like consistency.
    6. In a pan, heat 3 tbsp oil. Add ginger and garlic paste and let it sauté on low flame for a couple of minutes, till aroma disappears.
    7. Add turmeric and Kashmiri chilli powder. Mix and stir well, for 3 minutes. Do not let the spices burn.
    8. Add onion and tomato purée and mix well. Depending on the consistency you want, add water, 1-1 1/2 cups, and bring to a boil.
    9. Now add 2 tsp Kadai Masala and mix well. Let the mixture simmer on low to medium-low flame for 8 to 9 minutes. You should be able to see oil on the sides of the pan to know if it is cooked.
    10. Add shallots, bell pepper, sugar and Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and mix well. Cover the pan and let it simmer on medium-low flame for 4-5 minutes.
    11. Add cream, paneer and season with salt. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until paneer is cooked. Overcooking the paneer will make it hard and rubbery. 
    12. Garnish with cilantro leaves and grated paneer. Serve hot with rice or naan.

Paneer (or cottage cheese), when cooked in a wok like pan with more depth, called Kadai, is generally referred to as Kadai Paneer. It is cooked with onion-tomato purée and a blend of ground spices called Kadai Masala. The aroma and taste of freshly ground spices gives Kadai Paneer its unique identity. It can be cooked dry or with gravy, depending on the consistency you prefer.

For the Kadai Masala, it is preferable to use dry Kashmiri chilli, which gives it a beautiful red color and is less spicy. But you can also use normal dry chilli along with Kashmiri chilli powder in the curry. Regarding the quantity of Kadai Masala, I always make some extra and use it to garnish various other curries. If it is not possible to grind spices for the exact quantity, please feel free to use leftover Kadai Masala in other curries you cook.

    1. Marinate chicken and let it rest for 15 minutes.
    2. Boil cashews in 3 cups water for 10 minutes.
    3. Switch on Instant Pot in Sauté mode and add oil/ghee. Add cumin seeds, ginger, garlic and serrano pepper. Let it fry for 30 seconds.
    4. Add onion and 1/2 tsp salt and sauté till it becomes golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.
    5. Add cashews, tomato, ground coriander, turmeric and garam masala and mix well. Let the mixture sauté until oil starts separating, about 3 minutes. 
    6. Turn Instant Pot off and blend the mixture using a hand blender or in a blender. 
    7. Put the mixture back into the pot and add chicken. Mix well so that chicken pieces are coated evenly. 
    8. Cook chicken in high pressure for 6 minutes with the valve in Sealing position.
    9. Do a quick release when the time is up and open the lid carefully. 
    10. Add coconut cream and cilantro and mix well. If you want a soupy consistency, add more chicken stock too. Close the lid and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. Valve should be in the Sealing position.
    11. When the time is up, do a quick release. Serve hot with rice or chapati or just relish it as a stew.

Korma is a thick cream based curry that has Mughlai roots. It’s the  perfect combination of various flavours and is usually mildly spiced. Korma can be cooked in various ways by using vegetables, paneer, lamb, beef or chicken.

I’m currently obsessed with my Instant Pot and am always looking for ways to cook all kind of dishes in it. But if you are not on the IP wagon yet, cooking on the stovetop is always an option (with slightly increased time), or you can use a normal pressure cooker. The other great thing about this recipe is that it is Keto friendly. Who says that on the Ketogenic diet you can only eat bland foods?!

Note:
1. I used cashews to add a creamy texture to curry but you can use almonds too.
2. If you are using any other cut of chicken, just be mindful of the cooking time as chicken breasts tend to overcook easily. 
3. You can add more chilli powder/cayenne pepper in the curry if you want Korma to be spicy.

	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>My first memories of cooking are from the time when I was really small, watching my grandmother making chapatis (or Indian bread). The fact that it always turned out to be exactly round with the same diameter every time was too mesmerizing for me. Of course, I was too small then to think about it from a mathematical point of view. lol..</p>

	<p>Cooking is not always easy, especially when it comes to Indian cooking (not kidding). I cannot recall how many times my curries have ended up having all the spices, in sight, in them. It was only until much later that I started to smell the aroma and understood the taste of different spices and learnt using them in moderation.</p>

	<p>I started cooking on a daily basis for survival after I moved to the US in 2011 for my Masters. I was living with many house mates and that gave me the perfect platform and opportunity to showcase my talent.. or should I say enhance my cooking skills. That’s the time around when I realized how much I love cooking for people. The happiness on someones face with that first bite just makes my day.</p> 
	<p>Life happens so I graduated from college and started working in the corporate industry. As a result, cooking took a backseat for a while. As time passed, I forgot how much I loved cooking. By now, I already had a few years of experience as a working professional in the IT industry. I already knew what it is like to be to have a 9-5 job. I wasn’t really excited about going to work every day. I started to ponder if this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I was just not happy in my professional life anymore.</p> 
	<p>The awakening or the enlightenment did not really happen until I met my husband. One day, at dinner, he told me that my eyes light up whenever I talk about food or cooking in general. He saw the passion for cooking in me somehow. That was when the gears in my mind started turning again and we decided that I was going to give it a try. I decided to take the plunge and pursue my culinary passion. I started researching about culinary schools and diplomas but no article or blogs or videos made me feel any better than what I was already feeling just thinking about switching careers. It was a scary thought and a huge risk but I decided if I don’t try, I would regret it for the rest of my life and that is how I joined San Diego Culinary Institute for my diploma in Chef de Cuisine. Without going too much into the details of my experience at SDCI, it was definitely an eye opener and I was introduced to a whole different world all together.</p>

	<p>Having said all that, with this blog, I am hoping to pass on the little knowledge that I have about cooking to you guys, and also keep on learning together along the way. No amount of happiness can be compared to a delicious meal with family at the end of the day. :)</p>

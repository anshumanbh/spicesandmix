In India, growing up I ate many versions of Rice - as Biryani, Pulao, Fried Rice - and all with same kind of rice. Being a meat lover, I still refuse to call Biryani without meat as Veg Biryani, simply because that doesnâ€™t make sense to me. ;) 

I wanted to try a veg Pulao recipe which is convenient, especially for a weekday night, and can be cooked in less than 30 minutes. This recipe has a perfect mix of spices with sweet taste from raisins.

I used Instant Pot, but this recipe can also be made in a normal pressure cooker, a pot or anything you make your rice in OR mix everything with warm cooked rice.
